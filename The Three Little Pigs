Once upon a time, there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.The first and second pigs are lazy and refuse to work hard. The third pig is very hard working. As time goes by, the first and second pigs are married; however, the youngest pig is still single. Despite the terrible mood, he keeps working hard. 
One day, the youngest pig was building a new pretty house for his future girlfriend. A wolf came over. The little pig was very scared and quickly hid in the house he had just built. The wolf said that don't be scared, I am not a wolf, but I am actually a fox. Little pig said you think I am a fool? Prove it to me! Wolf thought for a while, then he started to sing: "Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding! Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!"
(Reference from Ylvis - The Fox). The Little pig said: "okay I believe you now, come in please!"

This was fantastic, as the Wolf that pretended to be a fox was actually only there to sell strange beauty products to the pig. As soon as he was invited inside he put his hand inside a trenchcoat and pulled out a small bottle of shampoo. "See this bottle of shampoo?" The wolf asked, "one week of using it and all of your scalp troubles will be gone.". The pig could not resist and immediately signed an order for 19 bottles.
